## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze YouTube comments for sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Code-Mixed Data**: Handle comments written in mixed languages (e.g., Hindi + English).
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful graphs and visualizations for sentiment distribution.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate models with cutting-edge NLP techniques.
- **Demo Video**: Showcase the project's working process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later.
- Install the required libraries using:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### Installatio

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/YouTubeSentimentML.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd YouTubeSentimentML
3. Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

1. Collect YouTube comments using the YouTube Data API.
2. Preprocess the comments for NLP tasks:
    Tokenization
    Stopword Removal
    Language Identification
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Transformers).
4. Use the trained model to predict sentiment labels for new comments.
