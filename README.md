# YouTubeSentimentML

A sentiment analysis project designed to classify YouTube comments as positive, negative, or neutral, using machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and the challenges of handling code-mixed language data.

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze YouTube comments for sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Code-Mixed Data**: Handle comments written in mixed languages (e.g., Hindi + English).
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful graphs and visualizations for sentiment distribution.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate models with cutting-edge NLP techniques.
- **Demo Video**: Showcase the project's working process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later.
- Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/YouTubeSentimentML.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd YouTubeSentimentML
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Collect YouTube comments using the YouTube Data API.
Preprocess the comments for NLP tasks:
Tokenization
Stopword Removal
Language Identification
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Transformers).
Use the trained model to predict sentiment labels for new comments.
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py

Code-Mixed Preprocessing

Future Roadmap
Implement deep learning models (e.g., BERT or LSTM).
Add support for more code-mixed languages.
Deploy the project as a web app using Flask or Django.
Create a REST API for real-time sentiment analysis.
