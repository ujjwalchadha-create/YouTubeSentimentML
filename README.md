# YouTubeSentimentML

A sentiment analysis project designed to classify YouTube comments as positive, negative, or neutral, using machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and the challenges of handling code-mixed language data.

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze YouTube comments for sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Code-Mixed Data**: Handle comments written in mixed languages (e.g., Hindi + English).
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful graphs and visualizations for sentiment distribution.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate models with cutting-edge NLP techniques.
- **Demo Video**: Showcase the project's working process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later.
- Install the required libraries using:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### Installatio

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/YouTubeSentimentML.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd YouTubeSentimentML
3. Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

1. Collect YouTube comments using the YouTube Data API.
2. Preprocess the comments for NLP tasks:
    Tokenization
    Stopword Removal
    Language Identification
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Transformers).
4. Use the trained model to predict sentiment labels for new comments.

## Future Roadmap

1. Implement deep learning models (e.g., BERT or LSTM).
2. Add support for more code-mixed languages.
3. Deploy the project as a web app using Flask or Django.
4. Create a REST API for real-time sentiment analysis.
