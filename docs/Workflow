Workflow for Using Models and Libraries

1. Data Preprocessing

Remove special characters and unwanted patterns using Regex.

Tokenize and normalize text using NLTK.

Use LangDetect to identify the language and handle code-mixed data.

2. Feature Extraction

Convert text data into numerical form using TF-IDF (Scikit-learn).

Alternatively, use word embeddings via TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models.

3. Model Training and Evaluation

Train the Logistic Regression, SVM, and LSTM models on the preprocessed data.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Visualization

Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize sentiment distribution and model performance.
