Models Used in YouTubeSentimentML

Overview

This document provides an overview of the machine learning models employed in the YouTubeSentimentML project, explaining their purpose and significance.

1. Logistic Regression

Purpose: A baseline model for binary and multi-class sentiment classification.

Why Used:

Fast and efficient for text classification tasks.

Provides interpretability for understanding feature importance.

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Purpose: Handles text classification tasks effectively with high-dimensional data.

Why Used:

Known for robustness with small-to-medium datasets.

Effective in separating complex decision boundaries.

3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Purpose: Captures sequential dependencies in text data.

Why Used:

Excellent for handling temporal or sequence data.

Mitigates the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs.

4. Random Forest

Purpose: Ensemble-based classification model.

Why Used:

Provides robust predictions by combining multiple decision trees.

Handles overfitting better than individual trees.

5. Pretrained Models (BERT)

Purpose: Advanced NLP model for contextual embeddings.

Why Used:

Captures word-level context and semantics.

Delivers state-of-the-art results for sentiment analysis tasks.
